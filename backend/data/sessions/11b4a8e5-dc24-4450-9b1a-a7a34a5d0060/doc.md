## Introduction

Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that immerses users in a fully digital environment, allowing for interactive experiences that can simulate real or imaginary worlds. While VR creates a separate virtual space, augmented reality (AR) enhances the real world by overlaying digital elements onto it. The convergence of these two technologies is driving innovation across various sectors, providing users with richer, more engaging experiences that blend physical and digital interactions.

Augmented reality (AR) represents a transformative technology that overlays digital information onto the physical world, enhancing the user’s perception and interaction with their environment. By integrating computer-generated graphics, sounds, and other sensory enhancements, AR has found applications in various fields such as gaming, education, healthcare, and marketing. The evolution of AR technology has been driven by advancements in hardware and software, making it increasingly accessible and effective for a wide range of users.

Recent advancements in augmented reality technology have seen a surge in applications across various sectors. Notably, companies like Meta and Microsoft are innovating with AR glasses that enhance remote collaboration, while startups are exploring AR for immersive retail experiences, allowing customers to visualize products in their own spaces before purchase. Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence with AR is paving the way for more interactive and personalized user experiences, making the technology more engaging and accessible than ever before.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality dates back to the 1960s, with initial experiments focused on merging real and virtual environments. Over the decades, significant milestones have shaped its development into the sophisticated technology we see today.
