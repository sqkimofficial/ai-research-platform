## Introduction

Augmented reality (AR) is an innovative technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment. Originating from the convergence of digital technologies, visual computing, and user interface design, AR has evolved significantly over the past few decades. This research document aims to explore the historical development of augmented reality, its foundational concepts, and its transformative impact across various industries.

In recent years, AR has gained traction in fields such as education, healthcare, entertainment, and retail, showcasing its potential to revolutionize the way we interact with information and the world around us. Understanding the history of augmented reality is essential to grasp its current applications and future possibilities.

Introducing virtual reality (VR) technology is essential to understanding its close relationship with augmented reality (AR). VR immerses users in a completely virtual environment, often utilizing headsets and motion tracking to create an interactive experience. While AR overlays digital elements onto the real world, VR offers an entirely different approach by simulating a separate reality. The convergence of these technologies has opened new avenues for innovation, enhancing user experiences across various sectors, including entertainment, education, and training. As AR continues to evolve, the interplay between AR and VR becomes increasingly significant, shaping the future of digital interaction.

Oculus VR, a subsidiary of Meta Platforms, has played a pivotal role in the advancement of virtual reality technologies, which are closely related to augmented reality. Since the launch of the Oculus Rift in 2016, the company has focused on creating immersive experiences that blend physical and digital worlds. Its innovations have not only enhanced gaming experiences but have also paved the way for applications in education, healthcare, and training simulations. Moreover, Oculus Quest, a standalone VR headset, has made virtual reality more accessible to a broader audience, further integrating AR and VR technologies in daily life.

## Background

The journey of augmented reality began long before the term was coined. Below is a timeline summarizing key historical milestones in the development of augmented reality:

| Year | Innovator/Organization | Contribution |
|------|-----------------------|--------------|
| 1968 | Ivan Sutherland         | Developed the first head-mounted display system, known as the "Sword of Damocles." |
| 1990 | Tom Caudell            | Coined the term "augmented reality" while working at Boeing to describe a digital display system for assembly lines. |
| 1992 | Louis Rosenberg        | Created the Virtual Fixtures system, enabling users to interact with virtual objects overlaid on the physical world. |
| 1999 | Hirokazu Kato         | Developed ARToolKit, an open-source software library for creating AR applications. |
| 2000 | NASA                  | Implemented AR technology in the Mars Exploration Rover to assist with navigation and data visualization. |
| 2013 | Google                | Released Google Glass, a wearable AR device that provided users with hands-free access to information. |
| 2016 | Niantic               | Launched Pokémon GO, a location-based AR game that popularized augmented reality among the general public. |
| 2020 | Microsoft             | Released the HoloLens 2, enhancing mixed reality experiences for enterprise applications. |
