## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment. Initially rooted in the domains of simulation and visualization, AR has evolved significantly over the decades. With advancements in computing power, graphics, and mobile technology, AR has transcended its early applications, finding utility in fields such as education, healthcare, entertainment, and retail. This document explores the history of augmented reality, tracing its development from conceptual frameworks to contemporary implementations that are reshaping human interaction with technology.

## Background

The origins of augmented reality can be traced back to the 1960s, a period marked by pioneering research in computer graphics and human-computer interaction. The term "augmented reality" itself gained prominence in the 1990s, but the foundational technologies and concepts were established much earlier. This section delves into the significant milestones in AR's evolution, highlighting key contributions from various researchers and organizations.
