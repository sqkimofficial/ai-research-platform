## Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR) technology serves as a significant counterpart to Augmented Reality (AR), as it constructs immersive digital environments that simulate both real and hypothetical scenarios. Unlike AR, which enhances the physical world by superimposing digital content, VR engulfs users in entirely virtual realms, enabling interactions with three-dimensional (3D) environments and objects through advanced sensory interfaces. The convergence of VR and AR technologies has catalyzed groundbreaking applications across diverse domains, including gaming, training simulations, and therapeutic practices, thereby enriching user experiences and expanding the possibilities of digital engagement in professional and recreational settings.

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that enhances the real world by overlaying digital information onto physical environments. It has evolved significantly from its inception, impacting various fields such as education, healthcare, entertainment, and more. This research document aims to explore the historical development of augmented reality, the pivotal innovations that shaped it, and its current state in modern technology.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality dates back several decades, with roots in the fields of computer graphics and human-computer interaction. Early experiments and prototypes laid the groundwork for the more sophisticated systems we see today. The evolution of AR can be traced through various significant milestones, each contributing to its development and adoption.

| Year | Innovator/Organization | Contribution |
|------|-----------------------|--------------|
| 1968 | Ivan Sutherland        | Created the first head-mounted display, known as the "Sword of Damocles", which laid the groundwork for future AR technologies. |
| 1990 | Tom Caudell          | Coined the term "augmented reality" while working at Boeing, referring to the digital displays used to assist workers in manufacturing. |
| 1992 | Louis Rosenberg       | Developed the Virtual Fixtures system, one of the first functional AR systems, for the U.S. Air Force. |
| 1999 | Hirokazu Kato         | Introduced ARToolKit, an open-source software library that enabled the development of AR applications using marker-based tracking. |
| 2009 | Google                | Released Google Goggles, a mobile app that used image recognition to provide information about objects captured in photos. |
| 2016 | Pokémon Company       | Launched Pokémon GO, which popularized AR gaming and brought mainstream attention to augmented reality technologies. |
| 2020 | Microsoft             | Released the HoloLens 2, an advanced mixed-reality headset that integrates AR into enterprise applications. |

This table summarizes key milestones in the historical progress of augmented reality, highlighting the innovators and their contributions to the field.
