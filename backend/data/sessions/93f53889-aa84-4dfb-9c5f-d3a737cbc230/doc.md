## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that blends digital information with the physical world, enhancing our perception and interaction with our surroundings. It has evolved significantly since its inception, influencing various fields from gaming to education and healthcare. This paper explores the historical development of AR, highlighting key milestones, technological advancements, and the pioneers who contributed to its growth. By understanding the historical context of AR, we can better appreciate its current applications and future potential.

Virtual Reality (VR) technology, often seen as a complement to augmented reality, immerses users in a fully digital environment, distinct from the real world. While AR overlays digital information onto the physical world, VR creates an entirely new virtual space that users can explore and interact with, often using specialized headsets and controllers. The convergence of AR and VR technologies is paving the way for innovative applications in various fields, including gaming, training, and remote collaboration, highlighting their potential to transform user experiences and interactions in both virtual and augmented realms.

Recent advancements in augmented reality have been driven by technological innovations and increased investment in the field. Companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook are at the forefront of developing AR hardware and software, leading to significant strides in user experience and application capabilities. Notably, the integration of AR into everyday devices, such as smartphones and glasses, has made the technology more accessible to the general public. Furthermore, applications in various sectors, including retail, healthcare, and education, are evolving rapidly, showcasing AR's potential to change how we interact with the world around us. Recent news highlights the launch of new AR platforms and tools that aim to enhance user engagement and promote immersive experiences, indicating a promising future for the technology.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality can be traced back to the 1960s, but it gained significant traction in the 1990s with the advent of more sophisticated technologies. This section outlines the pivotal moments in the history of AR, detailing the contributions of various individuals and organizations.
