## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) represents a significant technological advancement that merges digital content with the physical environment, enhancing the way users interact with the world around them. This innovative technology has evolved over several decades, transitioning from theoretical concepts to practical applications in various fields such as gaming, education, healthcare, and industry. This document explores the history of AR, examining its origins, key developments, and the impact it has had on modern technology and society.

## Background

The concept of Augmented Reality can be traced back to the 1960s, when computer scientist Ivan Sutherland developed the first head-mounted display system, known as the "Sword of Damocles." Since then, AR has undergone significant transformations, influenced by advancements in computer graphics, hardware, and software. This section provides a timeline of key milestones in the development of AR, showcasing the contributions of various pioneers in the field.
