## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which immerses users in a completely digital space, AR integrates and interacts with the existing physical world, providing a unique blend of real and virtual experiences. VR, on the other hand, creates an entirely immersive environment, engaging users through visual and auditory stimuli. This technology has evolved significantly since its inception, driven by advancements in computing power, mobile technology, and software development. While AR enhances the real world with digital overlays, VR replaces the real world entirely, offering users a different type of experience focused on immersion and escapism.

Recent advancements in augmented reality (AR) have significantly transformed various industries and everyday applications. Companies are increasingly integrating AR technology into their products and services, enhancing user experiences through interactive features. For instance, developments in AR glasses and mobile applications have made it easier for users to access digital information in real-time while engaging with their physical surroundings. Notable innovations include the rise of AR in remote collaboration tools, allowing teams to visualize and manipulate 3D models during virtual meetings, and the integration of AR in retail environments, providing customers with virtual try-on experiences. These innovations not only improve user engagement but also pave the way for future applications in education, training, and entertainment, showcasing AR's potential to reshape how we interact with the world around us.

## Background

Oculus VR, founded in 2012, revolutionized AR and VR with its Oculus Rift, achieving over 1 million units sold within three years. Later, it integrated AR capabilities into its platforms, enhancing mixed reality applications and enabling real-time interaction between virtual and physical environments, crucial for sectors like education and training.

The concept of augmented reality dates back to the 1960s when computer scientist Ivan Sutherland created the first head-mounted display system, known as the "Sword of Damocles." This early prototype laid the groundwork for future developments in AR by demonstrating the potential for overlaying computer-generated images onto the user's view of the real world. Over the decades, various technological advancements have propelled AR into mainstream applications, from gaming and education to healthcare and military training.
