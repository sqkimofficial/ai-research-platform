## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that enhances the real world by overlaying digital information onto physical environments. By merging the virtual and real worlds, AR opens up new avenues for interaction, learning, and entertainment. Its applications span diverse fields, including education, healthcare, gaming, and architecture, making it a pivotal area of research and development in contemporary technology.

The evolution of AR can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with early experiments laying the groundwork for the sophisticated systems we see today. This research document aims to explore the historical progression of augmented reality, highlighting significant contributions, technological advancements, and the implications of AR in modern society.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality has its roots in various technological and theoretical advancements over the years. Here is a timeline outlining the significant milestones in the history of AR:

| Year | Contributor | Contribution |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1968 | Ivan Sutherland | Developed the first head-mounted display system, known as the "Sword of Damocles." |
| 1990 | Louis Rosenberg | Created the first fully functional augmented reality system called "Virtual Fixtures." |
| 1992 | Tom Caudell | Coined the term "augmented reality" while working on a project for Boeing. |
| 1999 | Hirokazu Kato | Developed the ARToolKit, a software library for building AR applications. |
| 2000 | Milgram and Kishino | Proposed the Mixed Reality Continuum, a framework for understanding AR and VR. |
| 2013 | Google | Released Google Glass, an early consumer AR device. |
| 2016 | Pokémon Go | Popularized AR gaming and demonstrated the potential of AR in everyday life. |

These milestones illustrate the gradual development of AR technology, from its theoretical beginnings to real-world applications that have captured the public's imagination.
