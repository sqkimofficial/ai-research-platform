## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that blends the digital and physical worlds, enhancing our perception of reality by overlaying digital information onto the real environment. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), which immerses users in a fully virtual space, AR enriches the user's real-world experience by integrating digital elements, such as images, sounds, and other sensory stimuli. The evolution of AR can be traced back to various technological advancements, which have paved the way for its current applications in gaming, education, healthcare, and numerous other fields.

As AR continues to advance, it is reshaping how we interact with our surroundings and the information we consume, making it a pivotal area of study in the technology landscape.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality has its roots in the late 20th century but has gained significant traction in recent years due to advancements in technology and hardware capabilities. The journey of AR began with simple experiments and has evolved into complex systems used in various industries today. This section outlines the historical milestones that have shaped augmented reality into what it is now.
