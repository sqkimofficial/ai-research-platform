## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that overlays digital information onto the physical world, enhancing the user’s perception and interaction with their environment. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), which immerses users in a fully digital experience, AR integrates and interacts with real-world elements, making it a versatile tool in numerous fields, including education, healthcare, entertainment, and industry. As AR technology continues to evolve, its applications grow increasingly sophisticated, leading to new opportunities and challenges in how we engage with the world around us.

This research document aims to explore the origins of augmented reality, tracing its development from early concepts to contemporary applications. Understanding the historical context is crucial for appreciating the advancements that have made AR a pivotal component of modern technology.

## Background

The history of augmented reality is rich and multifaceted, marked by significant innovations and contributions from various researchers and developers over the decades. The concept of augmenting reality has its roots in the 1960s but has gained momentum in recent years due to advancements in technology, hardware, and software.
