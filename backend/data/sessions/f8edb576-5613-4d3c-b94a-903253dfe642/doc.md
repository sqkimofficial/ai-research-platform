## Introduction

Augmented reality (AR) is a transformative technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment. This innovative approach has roots in various fields, including computer science, engineering, and art, leading to a significant evolution in how we perceive and interact with the digital landscape. AR technology has gained traction in numerous applications, from gaming and education to healthcare and industrial training, marking a new era in the integration of digital and physical realms.

As AR continues to grow, understanding its historical context is essential to grasp its current applications and future potential.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality can be traced back to early developments in computer graphics and user interface design. The term itself was coined in the 1990s, but foundational technologies were in place long before that. Key milestones include the development of various devices and software that have contributed to the evolution of AR.
