## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that blends digital information with the real world, creating an interactive experience for users. By overlaying computer-generated images, sounds, and other sensory enhancements onto the physical environment, AR enhances the user's perception and understanding of their surroundings. Emerging from the convergence of computer vision, graphics, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), AR has found applications across various fields, including gaming, education, healthcare, and industry. This document explores the historical evolution of AR, its foundational technologies, and significant milestones that have shaped its development.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality has evolved over several decades, with its roots tracing back to earlier technological innovations. The journey of AR is marked by pioneering efforts in computer graphics, virtual reality, and user interface design. Notably, developments in hardware and software have played crucial roles in making AR accessible and applicable in real-world scenarios. As AR continues to advance, understanding its historical context provides insight into its current applications and future potential.
