## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, allowing users to interact with both physical and virtual elements. The concept of AR has evolved significantly since its inception, influencing various fields such as gaming, education, healthcare, and retail. This document explores the historical development of AR, highlighting key milestones and contributions that have shaped its trajectory.

## Background

The history of augmented reality can be traced back to the 1960s when computer graphics began to emerge. Over the years, various innovations and experiments laid the groundwork for what we now recognize as AR. Below is a timeline of significant events and milestones in the development of augmented reality:

| Year | Contributor(s) | Contribution |  
|------|----------------|--------------|  
| 1968 | Ivan Sutherland | Developed the first head-mounted display system, known as the "Sword of Damocles." |  
| 1990 | Tom Caudell | Coined the term "augmented reality" while working at Boeing to describe a digital display system for assembly lines. |  
| 1992 | Louis Rosenberg | Created the first fully functional AR system, Virtual Fixtures, for the U.S. Air Force. |  
| 1999 | Hirokazu Kato | Developed the ARToolKit, a software library for creating AR applications. |  
| 2000 | The MIT Media Lab | Introduced the augmented reality game "AR Quake," the first outdoor AR game. |  
| 2008 | Wikitude | Launched the first AR browser for mobile devices, enabling users to view AR content through their smartphones. |  
| 2013 | Google | Released Google Glass, a wearable AR device that integrates digital information into the user's field of vision. |  
| 2016 | Pokémon GO | Popularized AR in gaming, encouraging millions to engage with augmented reality through mobile devices. |  
| 2020 | Microsoft | Released HoloLens 2, enhancing AR applications for enterprise use with improved hardware and software. |  

These milestones reflect the continuous evolution of augmented reality technology and its growing impact on various industries. As AR continues to advance, it promises to offer even more immersive and interactive experiences in the future.
