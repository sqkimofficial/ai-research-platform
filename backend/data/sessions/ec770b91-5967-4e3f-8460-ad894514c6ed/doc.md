## Introduction
Augmented reality (AR) is a transformative technology that blends the physical and digital worlds by overlaying digital information onto real-world environments. This innovative approach enhances the way we interact with our surroundings, offering new possibilities across various sectors, including entertainment, education, healthcare, and industry. As AR technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to understand its historical roots and the key milestones that have shaped its development.

## Background
