## Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) represent two distinct yet interconnected realms of immersive technology that have gained significant traction in recent years. While both technologies aim to enhance user experiences and facilitate interaction with digital content, they do so in fundamentally different ways. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enriching the user's perception of their environment, while VR immerses users in a fully virtual environment, isolating them from the physical world. This research paper aims to explore the key differences between AR and VR, examining their applications, technological advancements, and potential future developments. By analyzing these two technologies, we can better understand their unique contributions to various fields such as education, healthcare, entertainment, and beyond, and evaluate their impact on society as a whole.
