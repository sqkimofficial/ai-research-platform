# Introduction

Augmented Reality (AR) is a transformative technology that overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment. The roots of AR can be traced back to the 1960s, with significant advancements occurring over the decades that followed.

The concept of augmenting reality began with Ivan Sutherland's development of the first head-mounted display system, known as the Sword of Damocles, in 1968. This pioneering device allowed users to experience simple computer-generated graphics superimposed on their view of the real world, laying the foundational principles for future AR technologies.

Throughout the 1990s, AR started gaining traction in various fields, including military training and medical applications. The advent of more sophisticated computer graphics and the expansion of computer processing power facilitated the development of more advanced AR systems.

By the early 2000s, the emergence of mobile devices equipped with cameras and sensors opened new possibilities for AR applications, leading to its adoption in gaming, education, and retail. The launch of AR applications like Pokémon GO in 2016 brought widespread attention to the technology, demonstrating its potential to engage users in immersive experiences.

Today, AR continues to evolve, driven by advancements in hardware, software, and user interface design, paving the way for innovative applications across numerous industries.
