## Introduction

Augmented reality (AR) has emerged as a transformative technology that blends digital information with the real world, enhancing the user's perception and interaction with their environment. This innovative field has evolved significantly since its inception, driven by advancements in computer vision, graphics, and sensor technologies. The applications of AR span various sectors, including gaming, education, healthcare, and industrial design, demonstrating its versatility and potential to reshape how we interact with digital content.

Recent advancements in augmented reality technology have been marked by significant innovations and widespread adoption across various industries. Companies like Apple and Meta are investing heavily in AR development, with Apple's Vision Pro headset promising to blend digital content seamlessly with the real world. Additionally, applications in fields such as retail, where AR is enhancing customer experiences through virtual try-ons, and in healthcare, where AR is assisting in surgical procedures, reflect the ongoing evolution of this technology. These developments signal a promising future for AR, indicating its potential to transform how we interact with both digital and physical environments.

## Background

The concept of augmented reality can be traced back to the 1960s, with early experiments laying the groundwork for future developments. Over the decades, key milestones have marked the progress of AR technology, setting the stage for its current applications and future innovations.

In 2020, researchers at Stanford University conducted groundbreaking studies on augmented reality applications in education and remote collaboration. Their work demonstrated how AR can enhance learning experiences by providing interactive visual aids and real-time data overlays, significantly improving student engagement and comprehension. This research not only highlighted the potential of AR in academic settings but also paved the way for future innovations in educational technology.
